# My Node Fundamentals Notes and Exercises

## Description: 

This repo is filled with my personal notes on JavaScript Promises and keywords Async & Await, as well as basic exercises involving two APIs: 
* üî¢[Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/)
* üÉè[Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)

The numbers API practice involved console.loging trivial information about my favorite numbers, and the deck of cards application has more of an interface where the user can draw a card one on top of the other until they lay down all 52 cards.  

At the very end of this unit, we have and exercise involing the Markov Machine, which can spew out a hundred random words from a url or file through the CLI like this:

$ node makeText.js url http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
... generated text from that URL ...
```
But the focus of the practice is to test with
